4. Release to create the connection

### Connection Rules

- Each activity can have up to 3 incoming connections (inputs)

Exporting allows you to save a flow as a file that can be shared or backed up:
1. Locate the flow in the "Process Flow" table
2. Click the "Export" button for the desired flow
3. A JSON file will be downloaded to your device
4. The file name will be based on the flow name

## Best Practices

### Process Flow Design

1. **Start with a clear goal**: Define what the process should accomplish before starting
2. **Use descriptive names**: Make activity names clear and descriptive
3. **Keep it simple**: Don't overcomplicate flows with too many activities
4. **Group related activities**: Organize activities in a logical progression
5. **Use colors strategically**: Assign colors to indicate activity types or departments

### Activity Configuration

1. **Be specific with descriptions**: Provide enough detail for others to understand
2. **Assign clear ownership**: Make sure responsibilities are clearly defined
3. **Set realistic deadlines**: Allow appropriate time for each activity
4. **Define clear approval criteria**: Be specific about what constitutes completion

### Validation and Testing

1. **Verify your connections**: Ensure all activities are properly connected
2. **Test the logical flow**: Mentally walk through the process to confirm it works
3. **Get feedback**: Have stakeholders review the process before finalizing


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Cannot Create Connection
- **Cause**: The target activity may already have the maximum number of inputs (3)
- **Solution**: Remove an existing connection or connect to a different activity

#### Issue: "Circular Dependency" Error
- **Cause**: The connection you're trying to create would form a loop
- **Solution**: Reconsider your process flow structure to eliminate loops

#### Issue: Cannot Save Flow
- **Cause**: Missing required information or validation errors
- **Solution**: Ensure your flow has a name and verify that all required fields are completed

#### Issue: Activity Not Appearing on Canvas
- **Cause**: Form not submitted or browser performance issue
- **Solution**: Ensure you clicked "Add Activity" after filling out the form

#### Issue: Changes Not Saving
- **Cause**: Not clicking "Update" after editing an activity
- **Solution**: Always click "Update" to confirm changes to an activity
